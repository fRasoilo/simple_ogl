simple_ogl is small library that provides a quick and simple way to create an 
OpenGL ready Window.

It is a single file header that should be very easy to drop-in and start using in any pre-existing project.

- It currently only supports Windows applications.

For a quick start check the top of simple_ogl.h in the section called "Basic Usage / Quick Start"/
